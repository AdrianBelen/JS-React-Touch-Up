# JS-React-Touch-Up

This is my comprehensive JS-React implementation to read/go-back to for instances in which I need JS/React.
All "finished" files will go here.

# Basic Branch
In the basic branch will be prototypes(coding for the project itself) as well as text files co-ordinated with code specifically for individual methods.
